This project is a decentralized property marketplace built using the Django framework. It offers tokenization and fractional ownership of properties on the Ethereum Ganache testnet. Property images are securely stored using IPFS, providing efficient and decentralized image storage. Users can register, login, tokenize their properties, and trade fractions of real estate on the blockchain. The application leverages Django's functionalities, Python's web3 libraries, Ethereum Ganache testnet, and IPFS for a seamless integration of real estate and blockchain technologies.

Key Features:
- User registration and login
- Property tokenization and fractional ownership
- Efficient and secure IPFS storage for property images
- Buying and selling properties on the marketplace
- Admin module for user approval and management
